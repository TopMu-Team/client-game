154	Congratulations. You have completed the mission. I'll give you a small reward for your hard work.	155	3	Continue listening													
155	Kundun made a bargain with Ereshkigal, the Queen of Pandemonium, and summoned Balgass on earth. Its mere existence is a threat.	156	-1	Continue listening													
156	We are guessing that Balgass, who leads the Pandemonium Army, is bringing new threats to the continent.	156	2	End conversation													
157	You don't have enough money. You must offer 7 million Zen to Rugard if you want to receive this mission.	157	2	I'll come back when I'm ready.													
158	Welcome. You seem ready to help us now.	159	-1	What do you need?													
159	According to the information we've gathered, Balgass has created a special place called the 'Barracks'. We, the Twelve Disciples of Rugard, believe that 'Balgass' Barracks' is our new threat.	160	-1	Continue listening													
160	To find out more information about the 'Barracks', and to reduce the threat of the soldiers being trained by Balgass, we must infiltrate it.	161	-1	Continue listening													
161	Thanks to Rugard's protection, we recently found a way to get into 'Balgass' Barracks'. Would you be willing to infiltrate the barracks, defeat the soldiers, and bring back more information about the place?	158	-1	Listen again	162	1	Accept	161	2	Reject							
162	Go to the cemetery to the north of Crywolf, and you'll find a runaway soldier from Balgass' Barracks. He was blessed with intelligence thanks to Rugard. He calls himself 'Warewolf Quarrel'.	163	-1	Continue listening													
163	He will take you there. Please identify the trainees at Balgass' Barracks, and kill 20 of each kind. 	163	2	End conversation													
164	You have completed the mission safely. I praise your amazing skills and strong will to fight even in the toughest of situations.	165	3	Continue.													
165	The information you brought back and the enemies you defeated will help bring peace to MU and Crywolf.	165	2	End conversation													
167	You don't have enough money. You must offer 10 million Zen to Rugard if you want to receive this mission.	167	2	I'll come back when I'm ready.													
168	Your courage has shown us that there is hope. 	169	-1	Continue listening													
169	It looks like Balgass is currently hiding somewhere, recovering from battle. 	170	-1	Continue listening													
170	In order to carry out Rugard's mission, we must find out Balgass' exact location and defeat the soldiers he's training.	171	-1	Continue listening													
171	This last trial to carry out Rugard's mission will be a lot tougher than anything you have faced so far. Will you accept the last trial?	168	-1	Listen again	172	1	Accept	171	2	Reject							
172	Go inside the castle gate to the north of Balgass' Barracks. We'll make the preparations so that you can enter.	172	2	End conversation
